## Installation

This software is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

It's published on npm as [weight-balanced-tree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/weight-balanced-tree),
so you can install it using `yarn` or `npm`.

## API

To create a tree, see `create`, `insert`, or `fromDistinctAscArray` below.

A tree consists of at least one value.  There's no tree of size 0; an empty
tree is represented by `null`.

Although there's only one datum stored per node, for maps you can store a
`[key, value]` tuple, or store `key` directly on `value` if it's an object.

```
type ImmutableTree<+T> = {
  +left: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  +right: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  +size: number,
  +value: T,
};

type InsertConflictHandler<T, K> =
  (existingTreeValue: T, key: K) => T;

type InsertNotFoundHandler<T, K> =
  (key: T) => T;

type ValidateResult<+T> =
  | {+valid: true}
  | {
      +valid: false,
      +tree: ImmutableTree<T>,
      +subtree: 'left' | 'right',
    };
```

### size

How many values are contained in the tree.

### update()

```
update<T, K>(
    tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
    key: K,
    cmp: (key: K, treeValue: T) => number,
    onConflict: InsertConflictHandler<T, K>,
    onNotFound: InsertNotFoundHandler<T, K>,
): ImmutableTree<T> | null;
```

Updates the value in `tree` found with `key`.  This is a generalized way of
updating the tree; for a simpler method of inserting values, see `insert`
(which calls `update` under the hood).

`update` is particularly convenient where you're using the tree as a map and
the keys are properties of the items being mapped.

The `cmp` (comparator) function is used to order the values.  It receives
`key` as its first argument, and a value of type `T` from `tree` as its
second argument.  The behavior should match that of `Array.prototype.sort`'s
`compareFunction`; the only difference is that `K` and `T` can be different
types.

Many other functions of this library require `cmp` in order to navigate the
tree; obviously, `cmp` should be idempotent and behave consistently for a
particular tree, otherwise the tree can become invalid.

`onConflict` allows you to configure what happens when `key` already exists in
the tree.  It receives the existing tree value as its first argument, and the
`key` passed to `update` as its second argument.

`onConflict` is expected to return a final value to be inserted, or throw an
error if the value shouldn't exist.  This allows you to merge both values in
some way if needed.  However, the returned value must have the same order or
position in the tree as before (otherwise a `ValueOrderError` is thrown).

If you return `existingTreeValue` from `onConflict`, `update` will return the
same `tree` reference back.  `Object.is` is used to determine if the value
you return is the same as `existingTreeValue`.

There are several exports in [`weight-balanced-tree/update`](src/update.js)
that can be used for `onConflict`:

 * `onConflictThrowError`, which throws `ValueExistsError`.
 * `onConflictKeepTreeValue`, which just returns the existing tree value back
   unmodified.  In this case, `insert` will also return the same tree
   reference back.
 * `onConflictUseGivenValue`, which replaces the existing tree value with the
   value given to `update`.

`onNotFound` executes when `key` is not found in the tree.  It only receives
one argument, the `key` you passed to `update`.  Like `onConflict`, you are
expected to return a final value of type `T` to be inserted.

`onNotFound` is useful in at least a couple scenarios:

  * You want to create the value to insert lazily, only if it doesn't exist.
  * You want to throw an error if the value doesn't exist (because you expect
    to replace it).

The following exports in [`weight-balanced-tree/update`](src/update.js)
can be used for `onNotFound` instead of defining your own:

 * `onNotFoundUseGivenValue`, which is what `insert` and all associated
   helpers default to.  Note that the given value in this case is the `key`,
   so this only works in cases where `K` is a subtype of `T`.
 * `onNotFoundDoNothing`, which causes `update` to do nothing and return the
   same `tree` reference back if the key doesn't exist.
 * `onNotFoundThrowError`, which throws a `ValueNotFoundError` if the key
   doesn't exist.

Here's an example of sorting/mapping objects by a simple key property and
lazily creating them:

```TypeScript
interface Item {
  readonly key: number;
}

function compareKeyWithItemKey(key: number, item: Item): number {
  return key - item.key;
}

function onNotFoundCreateItemFromKey(key: number): Item {
  return {key};
}

update<Item, number>(
  tree,
  /* key = */ 1,
  compareKeyWithItemKey,
  onConflictThrowError,
  onNotFoundCreateItemFromKey,
);

// a "find or insert" implementation:

let item2;
update<Item, number>(
  tree,
  /* key = */ 1,
  compareKeyWithItemKey,
  (existingItem: Item) => {
    item2 = existingItem;
  },
  (key: number) => {
    item2 = onNotFoundCreateItemFromKey(key);
    return item2;
  },
);
```

### insert()

```
insert<T>(
    tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
    value: T,
    cmp: (T, T) => number,
    onConflict?: InsertConflictHandler<T, T>,
): ImmutableTree<T>;
```

Returns a new version of `tree` with `value` inserted.  This is a more
specific version of `update` that only operates on the value type `T`.

`cmp` is the same as with `update`, except the first argument received is the
`value` you passed, and both arguments are of type `T`.

`onConflict` is also the same as with `update`, but here it defaults to
`onConflictThrowError` if not specified.

There are some helper functions available that call `insert` with different
values of `onConflict` for you:

 * `insertIfNotExists` (passes `onConflictKeepTreeValue`)
 * `insertOrReplaceIfExists` (passes `onConflictUseGivenValue`)

`insertOrThrowIfExists` is an alias of `insert`.

### remove()

```
remove<T>(
    tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
    value: T,
    cmp: (T, T) => number,
): ImmutableTree<T> | null;
```

Returns a new version of `tree` with `value` removed.

If `value` is not found in the tree, the same tree reference is returned
back.

If this was the last value in `tree`, `null` is returned.

The `cmp` (comparator) function is the same as used for `insert`.

`removeIfExists` is an alias of `remove`.

### removeOrThrowIfNotExists

Like `remove`, but throws an error if `value` does not exist in the tree.

This simply checks if the tree returned from `remove` is the same reference.

### equals()

```
equals<T>(
  a: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  b: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  isEqual?: (a: T, b: T) => boolean,
): boolean;
```

Returns `true` if two trees contain the same values in the same order, or
`false` otherwise.

This works by zipping the trees' values together, and passing each pair of
values to `isEqual`.

`isEqual` is optional.  If not provided, it defaults to `Object.is`.

### find()

```
find<T, K = T, D = T>(
  tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  key: K,
  cmp: (a: K, b: T) => number,
  defaultValue: D,
): T | D;
```

Finds a value in `tree` using the given `key` and returns it, or
`defaultValue` if not found.

`cmp` receives `key` as its first argument, and a value of type `T` from
`tree` as its second argument.

### findBy()

```
findBy<T, D = T>(
  tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  cmp: (treeValue: T) => number,
  defaultValue: D,
): T | D;
```

Finds a value in `tree` and returns it, or `defaultValue` if not found.

`cmp` receives a value of type `T` from `tree` as its first argument.
This allows you to pass in a closure that compares `treeValue` against a
static key.

### findNext()

```
findNext<T, K = T, D = T>(
  tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  key: K,
  cmp: (a: K, b: T) => number,
  defaultValue: D,
): T | D;
```

Finds a value in `tree` using the given `key` and returns the value
immediately after it, or `defaultValue` if there is no such value.

`key` does not have to be found in the tree: if a set has 1 & 3, the next
value from 2 is 3.

### findPrev()

```
findPrev<T, K = T, D = T>(
  tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  key: K,
  cmp: (a: K, b: T) => number,
  defaultValue: D,
): T | D;
```

Finds a value in `tree` using the given `key` and returns the value
immediately before it, or `defaultValue` if there is no such value.

`key` does not have to be found in the tree: if a set has 1 & 3, the previous
value from 2 is 1.

### fromDistinctAscArray()

```
fromDistinctAscArray<T>(
  array: $ReadOnlyArray<T>,
): ImmutableTree<T> | null;
```

If `array` is sorted and contains only unique values, then this returns a new,
valid, and balanced tree with the values from `array`.  (This is faster than
building the tree value-by-value with `insert`.)

If `array` is not sorted or contains duplicate values, then this returns an
invalid tree.  (Do not do this.)  You can check if a tree is valid using
`validate(tree, cmp)`.

### validate()

```
validate<T>(
  tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  cmp: (a: T, b: T) => number,
): ValidateResult<T>;
```

Returns a `ValidateResult<T>` indicating whether the given `tree` is valid
for the comparator `cmp`: all left subtree values are less than the parent
value, and all right subtrees values are greater than the parent value.

### indexOf()

```
indexOf<T, K = T>(
  tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  key: K,
  cmp: (a: K, b: T) => number,
): number;
```

Returns the position of `key` in `tree`, or `-1` if not found.

### at()

```
at<T>(
  tree: ImmutableTree<T>,
  index: number,
): T;
```

Returns the value positioned at (0-based) `index` in `tree`. Negative indices retrieve values from the end.

This is equivalent to `toArray(tree)[index]`, but doesn't create an intermediary array, and locates `index` in `O(log n)`.

An out-of-bounds `index` will throw `IndexOutOfRangeError`.

### iterate()

```
iterate<T>(tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null): Generator<T, void, void>;
```

Returns a JS iterator that traverses the values of the tree in order.

### reverseIterate()

```
reverseIterate<T>(tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null): Generator<T, void, void>;
```

Returns a JS iterator that traverses the values of the tree in reverse order.

### map()

```
map<T, U>(tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null, mapper: (T) => U): ImmutableTree<U> | null;
```

Returns a new tree with every value passed through `mapper`.
The mapped values are assumed to have the same relative order as before.

```TypeScript
const numberTree = fromDistinctAscArray([1, 2, 3]);

const stringTree = map<number, string>(
  numberTree,
  (num: number) => String(num),
);
```

### minNode()

```
minNode<T>(tree: ImmutableTree<T>): ImmutableTree<T>;
```

Returns the "smallest" (left-most) node in `tree`.

### minValue()

```
minValue<T>(tree: ImmutableTree<T>): T;
```

Returns the "smallest" (left-most) value in `tree`.

This is equivalent to `minNode(tree).value`.

### maxNode()

```
maxNode<T>(tree: ImmutableTree<T>): ImmutableTree<T>;
```

Returns the "largest" (right-most) node in `tree`.

### maxValue()

```
maxValue<T>(tree: ImmutableTree<T>): T;
```

Returns the "largest" (right-most) value in `tree`.

This is equivalent to `maxNode(tree).value`.

### toArray()

```
toArray<T>(
  tree: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
): Array<T>;
```

Flattens `tree` into an array of values.

### union()

```
union<T>(
  t1: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  t2: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  cmp: (a: T, b: T) => number,
  onConflict?: (v1: T, v2: T) => T,
): ImmutableTree<T> | null;
```

Merges two trees together using the comparator `cmp`.  `onConflict` handles
the case where an equivalent value appears in both trees, and is expected to
return the final value to use in the union (though it must have the same
relative sort order as `v1` and `v2`).  If not specified, by default `union`
will prefer values in `t2` when resolving conflicts.

### difference()

```
difference<T>(
  t1: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  t2: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  cmp: (a: T, b: T) => number,
): ImmutableTree<T> | null;
```

Returns a new tree with values in `t1` that aren't in `t2`, using the
comparator `cmp`.

### zip()

```
zip<T, U>(
  t1: ImmutableTree<T> | null,
  t2: ImmutableTree<U> | null,
): Generator<[T | void, U | void], void, void>;
```

Zips two trees together, returning an iterable of tuples: the first tuple
contains the first values of both trees, the second tuple contains the second
values of both trees, and so on.  If the trees are of different sizes,
`undefined` is used within a tuple where a corresponding value is missing.

### withComparator()

Returns an object with methods that have the passed `comparator` pre-bound.

```TypeScript
const integerTree = withComparator(compareIntegers);

let node = integerTree.insert(tree.create(1), 2);
node = integerTree.remove(node, 1);
```

Any function above that accepts a `cmp` argument is available.

## Performance

Performance will largely depend on the size of your data and the cost of your
comparator function.  [test/benchmark.js](test/benchmark.js) tests an ASCII table with
uniform-length string keys and a simple string comparator function.

Comparisons against [Immutable.List](https://immutable-js.com/) and plain
arrays are included for insertions and removals.

You can run `node test/benchmark.js` yourself.

## Tests
